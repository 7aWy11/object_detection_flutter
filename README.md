## üì¶ Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  object_detection_flutter: ^0.1.0 # Replace with the latest version from pub.dev
```
Then run `flutter pub get`.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  **Add Assets:**
    Place your TensorFlow Lite model (`.tflite`) and labels file (`.txt`) in your Flutter project's `assets` folder and declare them in your `pubspec.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    flutter:
      assets:
        - assets/your_model.tflite
        - assets/your_labels.txt
    ```

2.  **Import Package:**
    ```dart
    import 'package:object_detection_flutter/object_detection_flutter.dart';
    import 'dart:typed_data'; // For Uint8List
    // import 'package:image/image.dart' as img; // If you need to manipulate image objects
    ```

3.  **Detect Objects:**
    ```dart
    // Initialize the detector (ideally once)
    final detector = Detector();
    await detector.initialize(
      modelPath: 'assets/your_model.tflite',
      labelsPath: 'assets/your_labels.txt',
    );

    // Prepare your image data (e.g., from camera, file)
    // Uint8List imageData = ... ; // Your image bytes (JPEG or PNG encoded)

    // Run detection
    if (detector.isModelLoaded) {
      final results = await detector.detect(imageData);

      final List<Recognition> recognitions = results['recognitions'] ?? [];
      final Stats? stats = results['stats'];

      // Process results
      for (final recognition in recognitions) {
        print('ID: ${recognition.id}, Label: ${recognition.label}, Score: ${recognition.score}');
        print('Location: ${recognition.location}');
        if (recognition.keypoints != null) {
          print('Keypoints: ${recognition.keypoints!.length}');
        }
      }

      if (stats != null) {
        print('Inference Time: ${stats.inferenceTime}ms');
        print('Total Prediction Time: ${stats.totalPredictTime}ms');
      }
    }

    // Don't forget to dispose when done (e.g., in StatefulWidget's dispose method)
    // detector.dispose();
    ```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Implementations
Leverage the provided interfaces for bespoke detection and classification logic:
*   `ObjectDetector`: For custom high-level detection orchestration.
*   `ModelClassifier`: For fine-grained control over model loading, preprocessing, and prediction logic for specific model architectures.

*(See example interface snippets in earlier messages or refer to the source code.)*

### Performance Monitoring
The `Stats` object returned by `detector.detect()` provides valuable metrics:
```dart
final stats = results['stats'] as Stats;
print('Preprocessing: ${stats.preProcessingTime}ms');
print('Inference: ${stats.inferenceTime}ms');
print('Total Prediction: ${stats.totalPredictTime}ms');
```

## üß† Supported Model Types

The package intelligently attempts to determine the model type and apply appropriate post-processing.

| Model Category         | Typical Input Size | Key Outputs Expected                                    | Primary Use Case                     |
|------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Object Detection**   | 300x300, etc.      | Bounding boxes, class IDs, scores, num detections       | Multi-object detection               |
| **Classification**     | 224x224, etc.      | Array of scores per class                               | Single image categorization          |
| **YOLOv5**             | 640x640, etc.      | Classes, boxes, metadata, scores (specific YOLO format) | High-accuracy real-time detection    |
| **Pose Estimation**    | 257x257, 192x192   | Keypoint coordinates (x, y, confidence)                 | Human pose tracking (e.g., 17 COCO)  |
| **Face Detection**     | 128x128, 192x192   | Face bounding boxes, optional landmarks                 | Detecting faces in images/video      |
| **Image Segmentation** | 256x256, etc.      | Pixel-wise class masks or probabilities                 | Semantic/instance segmentation       |

*Input sizes are typical examples; the package adapts to the model's actual input dimensions.*

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

-   **Isolate-Based Processing:** Ensures heavy computations don't block the UI thread.
-   **GPU Acceleration:** Leverages NNAPI (Android) and Metal (iOS via TFLite) when available.
-   **Optimized Image Pipeline:** Efficient image decoding and preprocessing.
-   **Automatic Model Type Inference:** Simplifies integration of diverse models.
-   **Flexible Interfaces:** Allows for customization and extension.

## üìö Example Application

The `example/object_detection_test_app/` directory contains a **full-featured test suite application**. This app demonstrates:
-   All supported model operations.
-   Performance benchmarking.
-   Dynamic model loading and analysis.
-   Rendering of detection results (bounding boxes, keypoints, etc.).
-   Error handling and memory stability checks.

It's the best place to see the package in action and understand its capabilities.

## üí° Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues
1.  **Model Not Loading:** Ensure `.tflite` and `.txt` files are correctly listed in your app's `pubspec.yaml` under `assets` and paths are correct.
2.  **Poor Performance:** Test on a physical device. Emulators may not fully represent real-world performance or hardware acceleration capabilities. Ensure `detector.initialize()` completes successfully.
3.  **Memory Issues:** Always call `detector.dispose()` when the detector is no longer needed (e.g., in `StatefulWidget.dispose()`).
4.  **Incorrect Detections:**
    *   Verify your model's expected input normalization (e.g., \[0,1] or \[-1,1]). The default `Classifier` normalizes to \[-1,1].
    *   Ensure your labels file matches your model's output classes.
    *   Check the model's output tensor format if `_determineModelType` struggles or if you're using a very custom model.

### Performance Tips
-   Use models optimized for mobile.
-   Process frames at a reasonable rate if using a camera stream.
-   Ensure hardware acceleration is active (check device logs for TFLite delegate messages).
