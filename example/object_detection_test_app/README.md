# Object Detection Flutter - Complete Test Suite App

This application serves as a comprehensive test suite and diagnostic tool for the `object_detection_flutter` package. It is designed to run directly on an Android device or emulator to validate all aspects of the package's functionality, performance, and robustness in a real-world Flutter environment.

## 🚀 Purpose

The primary goals of this test suite app are to:

1.  ✅ **Verify Core Functionality:** Ensure all features of the `object_detection_flutter` package work as expected.
2.  ⚡ **Benchmark Performance:** Measure inference times, preprocessing overhead, and overall detection speed.
3.  💾 **Assess Stability:** Test for memory leaks and robust error handling under various conditions.
4.  📊 **Analyze Model Compatibility:** Provide detailed insights into loaded TensorFlow Lite models, including their structure, expected inputs/outputs, and capabilities.
5.  🧪 **Ensure Production Readiness:** Give developers high confidence in the package's reliability before integration into production applications.

## 📱 How to Run the Test Suite

1.  **Ensure an Android emulator is running or a physical Android device is connected.**
    *   Verify with `flutter devices`.
2.  **Navigate to the test app directory:**
    ```bash
    cd example/object_detection_test_app
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    (If you have multiple devices, specify the target: `flutter run -d <your_device_id>`)
4.  **Once the app launches, tap the "🧪 Run All Tests" button.**
5.  Observe the logs in the app for detailed test progress and results.

## 📊 Test Coverage

This suite includes a wide array of tests, meticulously designed to cover various aspects of the `object_detection_flutter` package:

### 🛠️ Basic Setup & Configuration
*   **Initialization Test:** Verifies successful model and label loading.
*   **Label Loading & Display:** Confirms labels are parsed correctly and provides insights into available classes.
*   **Error Handling:** Checks for graceful failure with invalid model/label paths.
*   **Disposal Test:** Ensures resources are released properly without crashes.

### 🎯 Core Functionality
*   **Basic Detection:** Validates a single detection run.
*   **Different Image Sizes:** Tests with various input image dimensions (e.g., 224x224, 300x300, 640x480, 1024x768).
*   **Different Image Formats:** Ensures compatibility with common formats like JPEG and PNG.
*   **Multiple Detections (Sequential):** Simulates rapid successive detection calls.

### ⚡ Performance & Stability
*   **Performance Benchmarks:** Measures average, minimum, and maximum detection times over multiple runs.
*   **Memory Usage (Stress Test):** Performs numerous detections to check for potential memory leaks or crashes.
*   **Large Image Handling:** Tests the package's ability to process high-resolution images.

### ⚠️ Edge Cases & Robustness
*   **Empty/Small Images:** Verifies graceful handling of very small or invalid image dimensions.
*   **Corrupted Image Data:** Checks how the package responds to malformed image byte data.

### 🔍 Advanced Model Analysis
*   **Model Information Deep Dive:**
    *   Analyzes the `.tflite` model file (size, estimated complexity).
    *   Displays detected model type (Object Detection, Classification, YOLOv5, Pose Estimation, etc.).
    *   Details input/output tensor shapes, data types, and batch sizes.
    *   Shows runtime configuration (input size, confidence threshold, max results).
    *   Interprets model capabilities based on its detected type.
    *   Provides a quick performance benchmark for the loaded model.
    *   Estimates memory footprint per inference.
    *   Analyzes loaded labels (sample classes, estimated dataset type like COCO, ImageNet).
    *   Offers deployment recommendations based on model size and type.

## 📈 Expected Results & Output

*   **All tests should pass**, indicated by a "✅ PASSED" status in the logs.
*   The final summary should report **100% success rate**.
*   Performance metrics will vary based on the device/emulator and the model used, but the app provides a baseline. For the default PoseNet model on a typical emulator, average detection times (including preprocessing and isolate communication) might range from 40ms to 200ms.
*   The "Model Information Analysis" provides extensive details about the `assets/model.tflite` and `assets/labels.txt` used by the test suite.

## 🪵 Logs

The application features a real-time, scrollable log view.
*   ✅ **Green text** indicates a passed test or successful operation.
*   ❌ **Red text** indicates a failed test or an error.
*   ⚠️ **Orange text** indicates a warning.
*   📊 **Blue text** indicates summary information or section headers.

## 🧑‍💻 For Developers of `object_detection_flutter`

This test suite is an invaluable tool for:
*   **Regression Testing:** Run after any code changes to ensure no existing functionality is broken.
*   **Feature Validation:** Add new tests here to validate new features or model types.
*   **Debugging:** The detailed logs and model analysis can help pinpoint issues quickly.
